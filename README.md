# Build Process

This package allows you to transform raw code into a browser-ready preview offline. It includes the original code in the `src/` directory and a custom build script with processors.

## Installation

Make sure you have a recent version of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and install the necessary packages:

```
# Using Yarn
yarn install

# Using npm
npm install
```

## Build

To build for distribution:

```
# Using Yarn
yarn run build

# Using npm
npm run build
```

All of the final output will be dropped into the [/dist/](./dist) folder.

## Server

Run a local server that will automatically compile your code & refresh when you save a change!

```
# Using Yarn
yarn run serve

# Using npm
npm run serve
```
